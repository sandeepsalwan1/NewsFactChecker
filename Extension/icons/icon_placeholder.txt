To publish your extension, you'll need proper icon files in PNG format:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or Canva.

Suggested design elements:
- A magnifying glass over text/numbers
- A checkmark or verification symbol
- Blue/green color scheme for trustworthiness 

For example, a simple blue circle with "FC" (Fact Checker) in white text with a small checkmark would work well.

Store the final PNG files in this icons directory, replacing the placeholder files.
